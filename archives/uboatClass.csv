These ships were all around 2000 tons while the British destroyers were closer to 1300 tons. Estimated cost per ship was 340,000 pounds excluding Admiralty supplied armaments putting the average cost around 520,000. The Tribal was finally accepted after no less than 8 design proposals. The design chosen was a powerful yet beautiful looking ship. The first 7 Tribals were ordered on 10 March, 1936 with the latter group of 9 Tribals being ordered on 9 June. The ships were formed into the 1st and 2nd Tribal destroyer flotillas. By 1939 the Royal Navy had learned that while the Tribals were larger they were just normal destroyers. Thus the flotillas were renamed 4th and 6th destroyer flotillas. 8 ships were built for the Canadian Navy and the first of those came into service in 1943. (4 more Tribals were being built for the RCN but they would not see service until after the war). Australia built 3 Tribal class destroyers, which were commissioned into the RAN. The Tribals were not really U-boat hunters but rather fleet destroyers. During the second half of 1940 the Royal Navy ships (except the war losses HMS Gurkha and HMS Afridi) had one twin 4.7"" gun turret replaced by a twin 4"" AA gun turret. The Canadian and Australian ships carried this arrangement upon completion. The original Tribals The original Tribals were a batch of twelve ships built for the Royal Navy in 1905 - 1908 and were the forerunners of the Modern Class of Royal Navy destroyers. Roughly of 1,000 tons displacement. Armament was in two variants; the first five had a main armament of five 12 pounders, the remaining seven carried two 4 inch guns. Names were after African tribes. These ships became known as the ""original 33 knotters."" They saw action in WWI in the Channel and the North Sea.

As the war progressed their fleet duties were taken over by new, more modern destroyers and they were only used as convoy escorts. In 1937 the Admiralty recognized the need for ships with a good long-range anti-aircraft armament and it was decided that a number of the old V&W-class destroyers were to be converted to fast escorts. In the early stages of the war some of the V&W class destroyers were slightly modified to suit them more to their role as convoy escorts. The aftermost gun was landed to allow more depth charges to be fitted and an 3"" AA gun replaced the after bank of torpedo tubes to increase the anti-aircraft armament. These ships were known as the short range escorts. By 1941 the Admiralty was forced to employ every available warship, suitable or not, to the task of convoy protection. Destroyers were not ideal for this task. They were too fast and therefore they had a lack of endurance and were over gunned. With more and more purpose designed escorts arriving on the Atlantic battlegrounds some of the V&W class destroyers could be spared to being refitted to make them more suitable as convoy escort in the future. These ships became the long range escorts. The modifications included the removal of no. 1 boiler and its funnel. This modification reduced the speed of these ships to 25 knots. The space that became free was used for increased bunkerage and extra accommodation. 'A' gun was landed and replaced by a Hedgehog ASW mortar.

Several ships owed this method of construction to their survival, HMS Javelin was mined and reduced to less than half her original length, but she was towed in and repaired.

The design adopted was based upon a whale-catcher built in Middlesbrough. 145 of these Flower-class corvettes were eventually built in the UK and they, led by a few non-fleet destroyers, formed the bulk of the escorting warships which fought the battle of the Atlantic. Their short length and shallow draught made them uncomfortable ships to live in; even when they were modified, after the fall of France, to enable them to counter the extended range of the German 'Wolf-packs'. A fortnight of constant rolling and pitching on transatlantic convoy duty tended to exhaust all who sailed in them. The ratings in the crews were mostly reservists with only a few key positions, such as Cox'n, Chief Bos'n's mate, Gunlayer, Chief Engineer etc., being filled by regular or recalled personnel; the officers were reservists, almost without exception, with the Captain usually ex-merchant navy. Service aboard was monotonous and debilitating for long periods, either because of the need for constant vigilance in the face of those twin dangers, the sea and the enemy, or because of, in the North Atlantic at least, the cold. When action came, it could be prolonged and brutal with the sight and aftermath of the sinking of freighters or of other warships. The torpedoing of a corvette itself would be especially dramatic: its few compartments below the water line would cause it to sink in seconds, with few survivors. Over 20 corvettes fell victim to torpedo or mine during the War. Normally sleeping conditions on board for officers and petty officers were relatively reasonable, but for the seamen in a crowded, stuffy and water laden forecastle they were a great hardship. The inability to store perishable food for more than 2 or 3 days led to a boring repetition of corned-beef and powdered potato for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Since most of the crewmen were young, persistent sea-sickness was the principal health-hazard. Home-leave was possible only when the ship was refitting or cleaning boilers, but local leave was liberally granted on both sides of the ocean at the end of convoy duties. After the Normandy landings in 1944, the Flower-class gave way in the Atlantic to the newer and faster frigates and Castle-class corvettes. German 'Flowers' France was building 6 flower class corvettes when Germany invaded in 1940. Four of these were completed to a modified design and served in the Kriegsmarine.  ",http://uboat.net/allies/warships/class/42.html

Compared to other powers the 10,000 ton Kents were somewhat inferior in firepower and armour, but had an unrivalled radius of action of 10,400 miles at economy speed. They were designed for overseas service in peacetime and for hunting down commerce raiders in war on the long trade routes of the distant oceans. They were built to be lived in as well as fought and had sea keeping qualities and living standards unequalled before or since in any class of warship anywhere. Their high freeboard allowed for spacious decks, but they were inclined to roll. Throughout the 1930s they became a familiar sight over the vast stretch of territory from Batavia to Japan that comprised the China station. They were the emblem and the symbol of British supremacy in Hong Kong, and in the roads off the Shanghai and Hankow bunds they stood guard over the British presence. During the war they logged up immense distances and were to be found, in all the oceans of the world, encountering arctic blizzards, the doldrums of the tropic seas and everything in between. Ubiquitous as they were, they seldom made the headlines but played a part behind the scenes of vital consequence. The design was determined by the priorities of the main armament and speed, with a long hull and high freeboard to aid speed and secure seaworthiness. Side armour was abandoned to provide increased air defence with a protective deck. This was an improvement over earlier classes, but was still not effective against bombs. The height of the funnels were increased by 15ft following trials. Modifications shortly before WWII increased the displacement to 10,300 tons standard. The class was reconstructed between 1935 and 1938, with additional armour being installed and the anti-aircraft armament being improved. The after superstructure was replaced with a conspicuous large hangar for 3 amphibians, but not in Kent.

A short flying-off deck was built over the bows, and the upper hanger opened up to this. There was no island until a small one was fitted during her 1939 refit and the boiler uptakes were led aft to discharge either side of the round down or lower hangar; this was an unsatisfactory arrangement and one not repeated in British fleet carriers as it led to problems with escaping heat and also meant that insufficient workshop space was available, so that part of the lower hangar ha to be used which meant a reduced numbers of aircraft could be carried. The short flight deck was disused before 1939 and the main flight deck, which was 91½in wide, had a usable length of 530ft, increased to 596 ft in 1943. The hangars measured 550ft lower, 52 ft upper x 50ft x 15ft; the two cruciform lifts were 46ft x 47ft, the forward one taking 12.500lb and the after 14.000lb and both serving either hangar. Petrol stowage, at 20.800gal, was limited. The flight deck was 1in steel and the total of other deck protection 2in max. The original bulges had been increased to improve stability but the system was only designed to stand 440lb TNT. Modifications: In 1939 Furious was completely rearmed with 12-4in. QF Mk 16 HA in twin mountings, and the 8-barrelled pompoms were increased to three. A fourth was added in April 1941 and subsequently 15-20mm Oerlikons were also added. In spite of her unsatisfactory features she gave good service during the war, and emerged virtually unscathed.

These each had two platforms, of which the upper one travelled between the flight deck and the upper hangar and the lower one between the two hangars. This meant that it took three movements to transport aircraft from the flight deck to the lower hangar. Petrol stowage was 100.000gal. The belt was taken to the lower hangar deck abreast the funnel, to the upper deck fore and aft of this and to the lower deck by the forward and aft 4.5in magazines; there was a 3½in armour deck at the various levels of the upper edge and over the steering gear. There was a sandwich type underwater protection with a 1½in protective bulkhead 13ft 4½in from the side amidships. The system was designed to withstand a 750lb charge but trials while Ark Royal was building showed that the bulkhead stiffeners had to be modified. There were three boilers and three engine rooms, and it should be noted that the tactical diameter was undesirably large at 1010yds.

The weight of the armour permitted only one hangar, and the flight deck was 38ft above the deep load waterline. There was the usual island and funnel, and the flight deck had an effective length of 620ft in Illustrious and 670 ft in the other two, later increased to 740ft in all by reducing the round downs. The width remained 95ft, and there was a single catapult capable of launching 14.000lb at 66kn. The hangar measured 458ft x 62ft x 16ft and the two rectangular lifts (which could take 14.000lb) 45ft x 22ft. Petrol stowage was 50.540gal, which was insufficient for the 52-54 aircraft it was found possible to carry in 1944-45 using a permanent deck park with outrigger stowage. The belt amidships was taken to the hangar deck, to the flight deck only on the starboard side abreast the island, and to the upper deck for the last 30ft fore and aft. The hangar side armour was complete and extended well beyond the belt ends, merging with the belt only by the island, and the flight deck was 3in over the hangar armour and 1½in at the ends and below the island. The lifts were not armoured. The hangar deck was 1in outside the citadel where it formed the hangar floor and 3in-2½in between the hangar walls and the belt, whilst the lower deck was 3in aft. Underwater protection was similar to Ark Royal's but improved in detail, and the designed GM at deep load was 8.26ft. Tactical diameter was about 1050yds., and there were 3 boiler and three engine rooms. The 4.5in guns were in low crowned 'between decks' mountings. Modifications; The light AA armament was altered during the war Illustrious eventually having 40 2pdr (5x8), 3 40mm (3x1) and 52 20mm Oerlikons. Formidable had 482pdr (6x8), 12 40mm (12x1) and 34 20mm Oerlikons while Victorious had 40 2pdr (5x8), 21 40mm (2x4, 2x2, 9x1) and 45 20mm Oerlikons.  ",http://uboat.net/allies/warships/class/100.html

After conferences between seamen, submarine commanders and naval engineers it was decided to install rather powerful torpedo and artillery together with mine weapons. Soviet naval command approved this project (II series) to be universal long-range minelayer/attack sub, intended to install mine defences onto fairways and enemy naval activities routes, to inflict attacks upon enemy warships and transport ships with a help of torpedoes and artillery. Mines were carried inside the inner hull in two long tubes of special design with hatches aft the boat. 20 mines were secured in dry condition inside this tubes until exact installation. First series of L class, built in 1929-30 (type II), had considerably long time of submerging (about 3 min.). Latter submarines (type XI, XIII and XIII-1938) had many improvements in equipment, weapons and range. They became really universal boats, fighting on all wartime theatres. Most success in score was achieved by minefields of this boats. ",http://uboat.net/allies/warships/class/211.html

That is why their abilities were modest enough - initial range of VI-series was just 800 nm (later series had 3400), maximum patrol duration - 10 days and just two torpedoes. But far patrols were not for them - these cheap, mass-produced boats were intended to defend naval bases, blockade enemy harbours and, as a main feature, be railway-friendly to be transported from one war theatre to another. Many of these boats were transported 18.000-20.000 km ashore (by railway) to cover 3000-5000 nm during their sea patrols or even execute patrols on Ladoga Lake near Leningrad. It is reported that Malutkas were world’s first fully-welded submarines as of 1932. There were four main series of M (Malutka): VI, VI-bis, XII and XV, where each latter has many improvements vs previous series (XV had four bow torpedo tubes) and fought at all theatres - Arctic, Baltic, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and at Pacific. The unusual features and advantages of these boats were confirmed during WWII. Russian word “Malutka” means “baby, little one'” Only 4 series XV submarines were completed during the war, 11 more were laid down during the war but were completed post war. Much more were laid down after the war but these are not included here.

Each was slightly improved (longer, more range). The figures here we give for the original boats. These submarines were designed to ‘execute positioning service on closed theatres’ and might be determined as medium submarines. The concept was adopted by USSR Revolutionary Military Council (Revvoensoviet) on January 23, 1930 and a huge program of their building for all four fleets of a giant country began in February, 1930. There were plans to build up to 200 Schukas of three main series - III (third series); V, V-bis, V-bis-2 (fifth series);X, X-bis (tenth series), so, this boats had to be the most numerous units of the Soviet Navy during WWII (really 86 units were commissioned before or during WWII). Seven yards were involved in this program - No189, 190, 194 in Leningrad, No112 in Gorky, No200 in Nikolaev and No202 in Vladivostok. Each series had several improvements vs. previous one. The name of these boats was taken (traditionally in Russia and USSR) from the individual name of the first boat Sch-301 ’Schuka‘ (Ùóêà) - Pike. Their numbers depended on destination fleet: 1XX-Pacific fleet, 2XX-Black sea fleet, 3XX-Baltic fleet and 4XX-North fleet. Pacific fleet Schukas resisted Japans without losses (excluding non-battle damages and incidents), but Baltic, Black Sea and North Schukas suffered great losses during war (70% of front-line boats).

They had to follow battle groups at high speed (22-23 knots) surfaced and to engage attacking hostiles submerged. IV type submarines had a high-speed adapted external hull and rather heavy artillery. The concept was ready in October 1930. The attempt to meet this technical requirements cannot be recognized successful. Small crush depth, very long time of coming underwater, bad manoeuvrability submerged at low speeds together with torpedo tubes usage limitations prevented treating these subs to be real battle ships.

It is a result of international cooperation between Germany and USSR in the beginning of 1930s. The USSR S-type subs (USSR IX and IX-bis series) were born from E-1 prototype, that was laid down initially for Spain navy in Cartagena by IvS (Dutch subsidiary of Deschimag AG Weser) in 1930. As the order was later cancelled, Deschimag had to search for new clients. Several countries including USSR were invited to get acquainted with E-1. In November 1932 three Soviet naval engineers inspected the boat and suggested purchasing line-drawings and documentation for later buildings at Soviet yards. The boat was considered to match the requirements of Soviet shipbuilding program partially, so, Deschimag had to work out the corrected project. In May 1933 seven leading Soviet naval designers and engineers made a business-trip to Bremen and Karhatena to perform sea tests of E-1 and work on suitable approach to further changes of E-1 project for German engineers taking in mind exact technical requirements of USSR navy. The new project was ready in the end of 1933 and named E-2 (USSR IX series) with enlargement of displacement, artillery and range. Three submarines of IX series were build in Leningrad and partially utilized German machinery. The majority of S-type submarines, however, belonged to IX-bis series, which had been developed taking into consideration just domestic parts and machinery supplies. They were built in Leningrad, Gorki and Nikolayev. As for technical features of the project, which were decided before WWII, Soviet navy had to fight onto closed war theatres, close to enemy shore and defences, so, long range and other qualities of ocean-going submarines of mid-class could not be achieved as subs had to stay submerged most of time and waste fuel for frequent charging. Nevertheless, under some evaluations, S-type submarines inflicted the most harm to enemy during war. As for IvS (Deschimag AG Weser) - they used E-1 and E-2 experience as a base for IA series boats, who, in turn, were mothers for famous IX-type Kriegsmarine subs. You should not mix USSR IX series and German IX type boats, nevertheless, they have the same relatives. ",http://uboat.net/allies/warships/class/215.html

The flight deck had effective dimensions of 680ft x 95ft, later lengthened to 745ft, and it was raised by 14ft to accommodate a second hangar. The catapult could launch 14.000lb at 66kts. The new upper hangar measured 458ft x 62ft x 14ft, and the after part of the original hangar was retained as the lower hangar with dimensions of 168ft x 62ft x 16 ft. The forward lift was increased to 45ft x 33ft, the after one remained 45ft x 22ft, and both could take 14.000lb. Petrol stowage was 75.110gal and it was found possible to operate 56 aircraft. The 3in armoured flight deck was retained but there were some alterations in the decks outside this area, the lower gallery decks being 2½in-2in over the magazines, and the lower or upper hangar deck 1½in over the machinery spaces. Modifications; HMS Indomitable had only 24 2pdr (3x8) when completed, and did not mount her full outfit until April 1942. In April 1944 she had 12 40mm Bofors (2x4,2x2) added and at the end of the war she also had 13 single 40 mm Bofors and 36 single 20 mm Oerlikons. ",http://uboat.net/allies/warships/class/410.html

The upper hangar measured 458ft x 62ft x 14ft and the lower hangar, which was aft, 208ft x 62ft x 14 ft. The clear height of only 14ft prevented the powerful Vought Corsair single-seat fighter from being accommodated. Petrol stowage was 94.650gal, which was low for the 81 aircraft that eventually could be carried with a deck park. The armour belt was not taken above the lower hangar deck, and for much of its length only to the main deck, there being no upper deck. The 3in flight deck was retained with 2½in-1½in on the lower hangar deck over the machinery spaces, while the magazines had separate 3in-2in crowns. Underwater protection resembled that of the Illustrious-class. It was just possible to accommodate the 4-shaft machinery, there being four engine and four boiler rooms, and the smoke ducts from the two port boiler rooms were taken across the ship higher up than in previous designs. Modifications; The light AA guns were increased by 8-2pdr (2x4), 4 single 40mm Bofors and 51 20mm Oerlikons in Implacable and by 10 single 40mm Bofors and 40 20mm Oerlikons in Indefatigable. ",http://uboat.net/allies/warships/class/411.html
